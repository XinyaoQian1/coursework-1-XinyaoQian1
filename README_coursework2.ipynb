To create a user story map, we take all the user stories and place them in sequence of how a customer uses the product from left to right. The vertical columns of a story map provide the details under the higher level story or theme.

The stories listed vertically are detailed out such that the top line are buckets of stories or a theme and the detailed stories come below. Story mapping is a great way to discover gaps in requirements and analyze flow, data, and the user journey. User stories and story maps are great analysis techniques for all projects.

In MVC, there are three distinct responsibilities: model, view, and controller. The model is where the data of the application is managed. It receives input from the controller. The controller is responsible for receiving user input and passing it to the model in a way that the model will understand. Finally, the view is responsible for presenting the model to the user.\n",
