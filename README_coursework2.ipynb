    " The Model-View-Controller Pattern. The MVC pattern is a user interface design pattern that promotes separation of concerns across multiple application layers. In MVC, there are three distinct responsibilities: model, view, and controller. The model is where the data of the application is managed. It receives input from the controller. The controller is responsible for receiving user input and passing it to the model in a way that the model will understand. Finally, the view is responsible for presenting the model to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design pattern was selected because MVC allows separation of concerns, the three distinct responsibilities are clearly defined. MVC also enables teams to work on these separate concerns\n",
    "    in parallel. This web project should be completed in a relevant short time. For a small team like UCLsoft, parallel working will save time and members have their own responsibilities e.g. one writing the view while another working on the model and yet another finishing the controller. Finally, it's a well-known pattern in many web frameworks. Considering the team members to be beginners, use MVC pattern means there will be lots of documentations available to assist their work.\n",
