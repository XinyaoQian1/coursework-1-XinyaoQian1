To create a user story map, we take all the user stories and place them in sequence of how a customer uses the product from left to right. The vertical columns of a story map provide the details under the higher level story or theme. For our online coffee store, user stories about browsing and searching would be on the left followed by selecting items, managing the cart, checkout, and on the far right, stories related to viewing shipping status or viewing previous orders. The stories listed vertically are detailed out such that the top line are buckets of stories or a theme and the detailed stories come below. Story mapping is a great way to discover gaps in requirements and analyze flow, data, and the user journey. User stories and story maps are great analysis techniques for all projects.

    " The Model-View-Controller or MVC Pattern. The MVC pattern is a user interface design pattern that promotes separation of concerns across multiple application layers. In MVC, there are three distinct responsibilities: model, view, and controller. The model is where the data of the application is managed. It receives input from the controller. The controller is responsible for receiving user input and passing it to the model in a way that the model will understand. Finally, the view is responsible for presenting the model to the user.\n",

This web project should be completed in a relevant short time, for a small team, parallel working will save time and members have their own responsibilities e.g. one writing the view while another works on the model and yet another finishes the controller.  Finally, it's a well-known pattern  in many web frameworks. For beginners, there will be lots of documentations available to assist their work.\n",

It's always a good practice to detach such login into separated managers than to pollute entity classes with it. The domain model only mapped important entities from the business perspective and thus we didn't even think about how the system will actually work inside. With the transition from the domain model to the class diagram, the number of classes will always increase."
